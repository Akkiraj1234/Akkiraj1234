## Future Projects I Will Work On

1. **Screen Time Tracker**: A C++ based GUI application designed to track screen time across all applications used. This project will utilize the Windows API for tracking on Windows and daemon processes for Linux. The application will be built using PyQt for the frontend and Windows API or Linux services for the backend. For data storage, SQLite will be employed to manage usage statistics.

2. **Advanced Task Manager**: An advanced task tracking application that integrates seamlessly with Google Tasks and Microsoft To Do. This application will allow users to queue tasks based on specific topics, making task management more straightforward. Users will be able to track their progress and view how many tasks have been completed. Additional features will include automatic scheduling of tasks according to weather conditions, as well as managing sleep schedules. *(Technologies:C++, Python, To be determined (C++ with Qt or Python with Tkinter/PyQt), Google Tasks API, Microsoft To Do API, SQLite, pandas, numb.py, matploatlip, seaborn, Cmake, ninja)*

3. **Web-Based Task Tracker**: A web application that mirrors the features of the desktop task manager, allowing users to track their tasks online. This project will utilize React for the frontend, Django for the backend, and PostgreSQL for database management. The application will incorporate Tailwind CSS for styling and Redis for caching and session management, ensuring a responsive and efficient user experience.
